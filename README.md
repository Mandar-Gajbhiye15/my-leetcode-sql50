# my-leetcode-sql50
Leetcode SQL 50 questions tried and answered by me.


## NOTE
-> This is a part of SQL learning process for me.
-> I am trying to solve the queries my way and it is natural that even I can get stuck.
-> So naturally, I also took inspiration from other's solutions and implement it.
-> I'll try to do it again once I complete it so that I get a better hands-on practice.
-> And eventually I won't need to look for other's solutions.
-> Hope people will find this helpful and they will try to complete it their way.
